# Wikidata SparQL API wrapper: Data collection from Wikipedia profiles 
A file with functions to help fetch various data of personalities (and other entities) from Wikidata, and a tutorial notebook showing how to use the methods.<br>

This repository was used to collect data of over 10000 painters for the projects [PainterPalette dataset](https://github.com/me9hanics/PainterPalette) and [ArtProject](https://github.com/me9hanics/ArtProject). (In contrast, WikiArt only contains painting data of 3000 painters.)

## How to use?

There are NO! non-standard dependencies for this module, all used libraries are part of the Python standard library. There is one optional exception: you need to install pandas if you want to use the `results_dataframe` function.

- Just download the ```functions.py``` file.
  
- To try examples, you can check the `examples.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook too.
 
All methods are stored in the self-sufficient ```functions.py``` file, which you can easily place in your work folder and import in any Python/Jupyter Notebook with `import functions`.

### Gather data of someone (van Gogh) from Wikidata

Use the ```get_all_person_info_strict``` or the ```get_all_person_info``` function (preferably the first - to not collect statue or other nonhuman instances - other options are *get_person_locations* or *get_exhibitions_by_id* which include less information). You can also write your own SparQL query if you want to gather other properties not included among these, the module has support for that. (Read [this section](https://github.com/me9hanics/wikidata-SparQL-data-collection?tab=readme-ov-file#sparql-queries-tutorial-for-other-attributes) if you want to know how to write your own queries).

Using the `get_all_person_info_strict` function for van Gogh:

```python
import functions as f

van_gogh_response = f.get_all_person_info_strict("Vincent van Gogh")
van_gogh_response
```

The returned response, in dictionary (JSON) format:

```
    {'name': 'Vincent van Gogh',
     'birth_place': 'Zundert',
     'birth_date': '1853-03-30T00:00:00Z',
     'death_date': '1890-07-29T00:00:00Z',
     'death_place': 'Auvers-sur-Oise',
     'gender': 'male',
     'citizenship': 'Kingdom of the Netherlands',
     'occupation': ['drawer', 'printmaker', 'painter'],
     'work_locations': [{'location': 'Saint-Rémy-de-Provence',
       'start_time': '1889-05-01T00:00:00Z',
       'end_time': '1890-05-01T00:00:00Z',
       'point_in_time': None},
      {'location': 'The Hague',
       'start_time': '1881-12-01T00:00:00Z',
       'end_time': '1883-09-01T00:00:00Z',
       'point_in_time': None},

        ...

      {'location': 'Maison Van Gogh',
       'start_time': '1879-08-01T00:00:00Z',
       'end_time': '1880-10-01T00:00:00Z',
       'point_in_time': None}]}
```


Print some information from the dictionary:


```python
print(f"Birthplace: {van_gogh_response['birth_place']}, deathplace: {van_gogh_response['death_place']}")

print(f"Birthyear: {f.find_year(van_gogh_response['birth_date'])}, deathdate: {f.find_year(van_gogh_response['death_date'])}")

print(f"Gender: {van_gogh_response['gender']}, citizenship: {van_gogh_response['citizenship']}, occupations: {str(van_gogh_response['occupation']).strip('[]')}")

print("\nWork locations:")
print(f.get_places_from_response(van_gogh_response))
```

    Birthplace: Zundert, deathplace: Auvers-sur-Oise
    Birthyear: 1853, deathdate: 1890
    Gender: male, citizenship: Kingdom of the Netherlands, occupations: 'drawer', 'printmaker', 'painter'
    
    Work locations:
    ['Saint-Rémy-de-Provence', 'The Hague', 'Ramsgate', 'City of Brussels', 'Etten-Leur', 'Dordrecht', 'Nuenen', 'Paris', 'Auvers-sur-Oise', 'Van Gogh House', 'Emmen', 'London', 'Amsterdam', 'Arles', 'Hoogeveen', 'Antwerp', 'Borinage', 'Tilburg', 'Maison Van Gogh']
    

For a nicer display of location, we can print each part manually; moreover with the residing period too:


```python
places_str = f.get_places_with_years_from_response(van_gogh_response)
places_list = f.stringlist_to_list(places_str)
for place in places_list:
    name,period = place.replace(",", " and ").split(":")
    print(f"{name}, between {period}")
```

    Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, between 1889-1890
    The Hague, between 1881-1883 and 1869-1873
    Ramsgate, between 1876-1876
    City of Brussels, between 1880-1881
    Etten-Leur, between 1881-1881 and 1876-1876
    Dordrecht, between 1877-1877
    Nuenen, between 1883-1885
    Paris, between 1875-1876 and 1886-1888
    Auvers-sur-Oise, between 1890-1890
    Van Gogh House, between 1883-1883
    London, between 1873-1875
    Amsterdam, between 1877-1878
    Arles, between 1888-1889
    Hoogeveen, between 1883-1883
    Antwerp, between 1885-1886
    Borinage, between 1878-1879
    Tilburg, between 1866-1868
    Maison Van Gogh, between 1879-1880
    

<br>We can get all this information by writing SparQL queries, which is what the library does under the hood. Let's see an example of a SparQL query, which we can run with the `sparql_query` function:
  
  ```sparql
    person_name = "Vincent van Gogh"
    query = '''
    SELECT ?person ?personLabel ?placeOfBirthLabel ?dateOfBirth ?workLocationLabel ?startTime ?endTime ?pointInTime ?citizenshipLabel ?occupationLabel WHERE {
      ?person ?label "%s"@en.
      ?person wdt:P19 ?placeOfBirth.
      ?person wdt:P569 ?dateOfBirth.
      OPTIONAL { ?person wdt:P27 ?citizenship. }
      OPTIONAL { ?person wdt:P106 ?occupation. }
      OPTIONAL {
        ?person p:P937 ?workStmt.
        ?workStmt ps:P937 ?workLocation.
        OPTIONAL { ?workStmt pq:P580 ?startTime. }
        OPTIONAL { ?workStmt pq:P582 ?endTime. }
        OPTIONAL { ?workStmt pq:P585 ?pointInTime. }
      }
      SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "en". }
    }
    ''' % person_name.replace('"', '\"')
  ```

What does each part do?

The ```SELECT``` row declaring the variables with names (with questionmarks in front) and only the ones that will be returned in the response (see how ?occupation is not included, but ?occupationLabel is). Some variables get a "Label" suffix, they represent the human-readable representative name of the person, whereas the "original" variable stores the identifier (like "Budapest" is the label and "Q1781" is its identifier). The ```SERVICE``` line helps to put these values in the Label variables, only having to include this line instead of a line for every label, this is a special feature by Wikidata. This is described [here](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SPARQL/SERVICE_-_Label) well, at the "Automatic Label SERVICE": *If an unbound variable in SELECT is named ?NAMELabel, then WDQS produces the label (rdfs:label) for the entity in variable ?NAME.*<br>
The ```WHERE``` describes what each non-label variable shall equal. Adding the ```OPTIONAL``` keyword makes the variable just supplementary, the query will still return a response if its not found.<br>
The ```?person ?label "%s"@en.``` gives the ?personLabel variable the name of the person. "%s" (like in C and C++) is a placeholder for a string, the string being ```person_name.replace('"', '\"')```, which basically just puts the name of the painter defined before, which is "Vincent van Gogh", and with the ```replace('"', '\"')``` functionality we put a "\" character before the quotation marks, to [escape these characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_sequence).<br> 
The ```?person wdt:P19 ?placeOfBirth.``` line and others tell which Wikidata item (entity) should the variable take as value. Here, it is a property, as represented by the "P", and P19 is the "place of birth" property of a profile. The "wdt" keyword stands for Wikidata "truthy", which basically points to a the properties-containing sub-URL. This substitutes the following SparQL code: ```PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>```. For most common cases, this is used, or the general "wd" keyword for specific items. Here is an example:

  ```sparql

    query = '''
    SELECT ?painter ?painterLabel WHERE {
      ?painter wdt:P31 wd:Q5;          
              wdt:P106 wd:Q1028181.   
      SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en". }
    }'''

  ```

This query is to find painters. The conditions are: those profiles, which have instance of property (P31) "human" (Q5) and occupation (P106) painter (Q1028181). 

### Load the data into a DataFrame

Just use the `results_dataframe` function.

```python
names = ["Bracha L. Ettinger", "M.F. Husain", "Henri Matisse"]
responses = f.get_multiple_people_all_info_fast_retry_missing(example_names)
df = f.results_dataframe(responses) #install pandas!

df
```

### A more detailed example
Let's try fetching location and time data in a practical example, for 3 artists (Rembrandt, Rembrandt Peale, van Gogh) from the [PainterPalette](https://github.com/me9hanics/PainterPalette) dataset:


```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

artists_wikiart = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/me9hanics/PainterPalette/main/datasets/wikiart_artists.csv")
artists_wikiart["death_place"] = None #None for strings
artists_wikiart["death_year"] = np.nan #NaN for floats
artists_wikiart["locations"] = None #This is to not have warnings from pandas.
artists_wikiart["locations_with_years"] = None

examples = artists_wikiart[(artists_wikiart["artist"]=="Vincent van Gogh") | (artists_wikiart["artist"].str.contains("Rembrandt"))] #3 artists

for index, artist in examples["artist"].items():
    response = f.get_person_info(artist)
    if response is None:
        print(f"Could not find {artist}")
        continue

    examples.loc[index, "death_place"] = response.get("death_place")
    examples.loc[index, "death_year"] = f.find_year(response.get("death_date"))
    examples.loc[index, "locations"] = f.get_places_from_response(response)
    examples.loc[index, "locations_with_years"] = f.get_places_with_years_from_response(response)

    if examples.loc[index, "death_place"] is None:
        print(f"Could not find death place for {artist}")
    if examples.loc[index, "death_year"] is None:
        print(f"Could not find death year for {artist}")
    if examples.loc[index, "locations"] is None:
        print(f"Could not find locations for {artist}")
    if examples.loc[index, "locations_with_years"] is None:
        print(f"Could not find locations with years for {artist}")

examples.drop(columns=["pictures_count","styles"])
```

## SparQL queries tutorial for other attributes

If you want to gather other attributes, you'll need to create your own queries, but the `sparql_query` (`sparql_query_retry_after`) and `sparql_query_by_dict` functions can help in that. In general, every attribute (property) has a unique identifier. For example, in this snippet `?person wdt:P19 ?placeOfBirth.`, you can see property P19 is the "place of birth".

Every query has: 

- a `SELECT` part where you define the variables you want to return (including labels for strings, to get human-readable results for strings)
- a `WHERE` part where you define the conditions for the variables, such as gathering the place of birth of a person using the `?person wdt:P19 ?placeOfBirth.`, or restricting to humans with `?person wdt:P31 wd:Q5.` (Q5: identifier of "human")
- a `SERVICE` part where you define the language of the labels.

The `WHERE` clause includes a line with the likes of `?person ?label "Vincent van Gogh".` (unless you query by Wikidata ID, such as Q5582 for van Gogh - consider using functions in the file if your task is gathering IDs) if you query for van Gogh. Optionally, you can add a language identifier such as `@en` after the name.<br>
To query multiple people in one query, you should define in the `WHERE` clause an expression similar to `VALUES ?some_variable_name {"Vincent van Gogh" "Rembrandt" "Pablo Picasso"}.` and then include a condition for the variables similar to this: `?person ?label ?some_variable_name.` - Wikidata will return the data for each person in a separate subdictionary. 

Typically, you would use the `personLabel` variable to get the name of the person, and the `person` variable to get the Wikidata ID of the person 

You can get some inspiration from the `get_query_from_input` function to come up with your query of various attributes. For each variable, you have to find the corresponding property identifier on Wikidata (Google it).

#### Query one person in one request
This is a typical SparQL query for just one person:

```sql
SELECT ?person ?personLabel ?placeOfBirthLabel ?dateOfBirth...
WHERE {
  ?person ?label "Vincent van Gogh"@en.
  ?person wdt:P31 wd:Q5. #humans only
  ?person wdt:P19 ?placeOfBirth.
  ?person wdt:P569 ?dateOfBirth.
  ...
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "en". }
```

You could run your query with the `sparql_query` function, and define your function similarly to `create_person_info_from_results`, to gather the results: `my_function("Vincent van Gogh",f.sparql_query(query)['results']['bindings'])`.

#### Query multiple people at once

This is a typical SparQL query for querying multiple people at once:

```sql
SELECT ?person ?personLabel ?placeOfBirthLabel ?dateOfBirth... 
WHERE { VALUES ?personLabel { {people_string} } 
        ?person ?label ?personLabel.
        ?person wdt:P31 wd:Q5.
        ?person wdt:P19 ?placeOfBirth.
        ?person wdt:P569 ?dateOfBirth.
        ...
        SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "en". } }
```

#### Wikidata keywords

For anything else, take a look at this reference picture taken from their website on Wikidata item keywords:

</div>

## Notes

The code can be a bit messy, but there are works and plans to redesign. A typical redundancy is between initial and improved versions of functionalities, which were figured out after many tries - it seems that querying one person at a time, in one language is the most stable, therefore many methods were built with retries in different forms. I only managed to find stable workarounds after many-many tries, so the code would need to be refactored already.<br>
This code needs some improvements to be released as a package, but ideal to collect extensive data once a while.
